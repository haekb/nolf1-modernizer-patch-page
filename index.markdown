The NOLF modernization patch fixes performance issues, and attempts to adapt the original classic for larger resolutions. 

## Key Changes

- Fixes slowdown with some UI elements (such as looking down scope, or picking items up)
- HUD scaling options for most HUD elements
- Replaced mouse input code for a more responsive experience
- Optional framerate cap to 60fps
- Optional 4:3 mode for cutscenes
- New Jukebox menu in Options

## Installation

Extract the archive file over your NOLF directory. 

Then in the launcher, go to `Advanced` -> `Customize` and add the Modernizer.rez file.

## Support

Please note this is an unofficial patch, it's NOT developed by Monolith Interactive

I'm providing limited support for bugs on the [issues tab of the github page](https://github.com/haekb/nolf1-modernizer/issues).

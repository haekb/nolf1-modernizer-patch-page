The NOLF modernization patch fixes performance issues, and attempts to adapt the original classic for larger resolutions. 

## Key Changes

- Working multiplayer out of the box
- Fixes slowdown with some UI elements (such as looking down scope, or picking items up)
- HUD scaling options for most HUD elements
- Replaced mouse input code for a more responsive experience
- Optional framerate cap to 60fps
- Optional 4:3 mode for cutscenes
- New Jukebox menu in Options

## Latest Patch Highlights

- Patched out GameSpy from dedicated/hosted servers and the server browser.
- Fixed a bug in ai path finding causing values to not always be accurate.
- Fixed a silent out of range bug that could cause enemies to disappear and travel to a nearby galaxy at FTL speed!
- Added a "Blackscreen Fix" work around for Intel HD graphics chips in Display options.
